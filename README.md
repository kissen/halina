Halina
======

`Halina` is an English dictionary for Android 8.1 and up. All records are stored
offline on the phone. `Halina` is my favorite companion when reading books in
the park

Features
--------

* `Halina` uses the [Wiktionary][1] dictionary ripped with [wikidictools][2].
* Efficient indexing of the dictionary results in quick lookup times.
* No ads, no trackers, all offline.

Current State
-------------

There is no public release yet. It would be nice if we could publish `Halina`
on [F-Droid][5], but right now it is too early.

Because `Halina` already works perfectly for me, development is slow.
